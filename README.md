# Hi, I'm Mohan Reddy

**GenAI Engineer | AI Data Analyst | Machine Learning & Automation Specialist**

I design, build, and deploy AI systems that automate real business workflows. My work ranges from **LLM-powered extraction pipelines (OCR + NLP), automated data validation engines, forecasting models, and real-time ML applications** deployed on cloud and on-prem environments.  

With 4+ years of experience across consulting, research, and large-scale engineering teams, I enjoy solving operational problems using **Python, Generative AI, NLP, Computer Vision, MLOps, and Cloud AI services**.

## What I Do

### **Intelligent Automation**
I build production-ready pipelines using:
- OCR + NLP (Tesseract, BERT, GPT, LangChain)
- Entity extraction, structuring, and validation
- LLM-driven parsing and reasoning engines
- Intelligent workflows for business operations

### **Data Engineering & Validation**
- End-to-end migration validation frameworks  
- Automated CSV/SQL consistency checks  
- ETL, schema comparison, data quality scoring  
- Browser-based interactive validation tools  

### **Machine Learning Engineering**
- Forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet, DeepAR, LSTM)
- Classification, optimization, anomaly detection
- MLOps deployments on AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes
